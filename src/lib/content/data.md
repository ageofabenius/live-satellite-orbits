# Data

Satellite positions are derived from publicly available Two-Line Element (TLE)
sets generated by the United States Space Force and disseminated by <a

TLEs describe an orbit at a specific point in time and are widely used for satellite
tracking, orbit propagation, and analysis.


The satellites shown include all spacecraft listed in Celestrak's public **active** catalog.  <a class="info-link" href="https://livesatelliteorbits.com">livesatelliteorbits.com</a>
maintains an internal mirror of <a class="info-link" href="https://celestrak.org">Celestrak</a> TLE data, which is served directly to this web application.
