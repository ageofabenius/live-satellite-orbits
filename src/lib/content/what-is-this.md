# What is this?

This is a three-dimensional visualization of the Earth and the satellites orbiting it.


The Earth and all satellite orbits are shown to-scale. Satellites are displayed in their current
computed positions at this very moment, you can learn more about this computuation under 
**Data** and **Methodology**.


This is not a live radar feed. It is a physics-based simulation using industry-standard orbital
data and computational models used in real satellite operations.


You can hover over and select individual satellites to view their orbits and details, and rotate
or zoom the camera to explore Earth's orbital environment.
